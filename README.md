Today is a sad day, because my favorite basketball player and star Kobe Bryant passed away.
He has been the life model, been the most inspiring person in my childhood. I tried to learn a lot of his basketball skills.
Condolence to all his family and all the best words in the prayer for him, RIP KOBE my idol!
